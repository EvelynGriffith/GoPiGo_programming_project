## Participation in Races

### Describe the specific decisions you made in your implementation. Also, describe the ethical or aggressive behavior of your robot for each race

We decided to set the motors to 98% because through trial and error we discovered that was the maximum speed the motors would be able to run at. We also decided to put a wooden long piece at the front to stabilize the box for the push race. Our robots behavior is ethical because it is programed to just go in a straight line and leave the other robots alone.

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

### Idea

Our Idea for the second part of our first project is to create a robot that draws pictures!

### Requested Components

We would attach a pen or marker to the robot and then it would drag it so that the pen drags along the paper as the robot moves. We would get it to draw the top of an icecream cone and then the kids can color it in!

## Robot for Community Demonstrations

We pre-programed functions that make the robot draw different shapes, such as triangles and circles. We will have the kids create a main function that combines these functions and then have them call the robot to execute the code, helping them to understand the basics of programming. Once they are able to get the robot to draw the ice cream, they can then color their icecream in. We will also be displaying the trial and error drawings the robot created, helping the kids to understand that no matter your skill level, you still will have to work hard in order to get the program to do exactly what you want it to. We want the kids to learn some programming and about the importance of hard work while having fun and being creative.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

During this project we actually struggled with some of our hardware. At first everthing seemed to be working smoothly but then our right motor stopped working. This resulted in the right weel not spinning. At first we just thought that the wheel was broken or that the washer wasn't doing it's job properly, but after testing these things, we came to the conclusion that it was in fact the motor breaking. We took a different motor from one of the robots that was not being used and replaced the broken motor with a working one. This fixed our issue with the motor, but we were still struggling with a battery that didn't seem to work as well as it should. We also replaced that piece of the robot and now Penny seems to be running smoothly!

Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this assignment and describe the biggest learning takeaways.

## Team Work

Describe the details of your team working strategy, specifically explain how did you complete this work as a team and describe the specific contributions of each team member.
