## Participation in Races

### Describe the specific decisions you made in your implementation. Also, describe the ethical or aggressive behavior of your robot for each race.
We decided to set the motors to 98% because through trial and error we discovered that was the maximum speed the motors would be able to run at. We also decided to put a wooden long piece at the front to stabilize the box for the push race. Our robots behavior is ethical because it is programed to just go in a straight line and leave the other robots alone. 

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

### Idea

TODO: Describe the application you have chosen to develop and provide a motivation for it. Include references (links are okay) to all resources you have used throughout your research for a project idea.

### Requested Components

TODO: If you need additional components (e.g., sensors), please add them in a list below, with links to websites where these can be purchased.

### Schedule

TODO: Timeline | Tasks -------- | ------ dates | task 1
