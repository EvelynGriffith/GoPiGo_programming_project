## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

### Idea

Our Idea for the second part of our first project is to create a robot that draws pictures!

## Robot for Community Demonstrations

We pre-programed functions that make the robot draw different shapes, such as triangles and circles. We will have the kids create a main function that combines these functions and then have them call the robot to execute the code, helping them to understand the basics of programming. Once they are able to get the robot to draw the ice cream, they can then color their ice cream in. We will also be displaying the trial and error drawings the robot created, helping the kids to understand that no matter your skill level, you still will have to work hard in order to get the program to do exactly what you want it to. We want the kids to learn some programming and about the importance of hard work while having fun and being creative.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

During this project we actually struggled with some of our hardware. At first everything seemed to be working smoothly but then our right motor stopped working. This resulted in the right wheel not spinning. At first we just thought that the wheel was broken or that the washer wasn't doing it's job properly, but after testing these things, we came to the conclusion that it was in fact the motor breaking. We took a different motor from one of the robots that was not being used and replaced the broken motor with a working one. This fixed our issue with the motor, but we were still struggling with a battery that didn't seem to work as well as it should. We also replaced that piece of the robot and now Penny seems to be running smoothly!
We also struggled with the specifics of the weight in terms of where the battery was placed on the robot. We started out with the battery on top of the robot, but after a while we realized that it was weighing the robot down and made sharp turns very difficult. We decided to move the battery back to the back end of the robot which ended up helping a lot. We also struggled with inconsistency in general. Becuase the hardware wasn't always working in a predictable way, we were often struggling to set the parameters for the project that would produce the output drawing that we were interested in. We wanted to have the robot draw an ice cream cone, but this didn't always work becuase the angles would change when the hardware changed. We ended up finding out that sometimes shutting off the robot and giving it a minute worked the best to help reset the hardware.
