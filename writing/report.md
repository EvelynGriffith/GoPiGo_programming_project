## Participation in Races

### Describe the specific decisions you made in your implementation. Also, describe the ethical or aggressive behavior of your robot for each race

We decided to set the motors to 98% because through trial and error we discovered that was the maximum speed the motors would be able to run at. We also decided to put a wooden long piece at the front to stabilize the box for the push race. Our robots behavior is ethical because it is programed to just go in a straight line and leave the other robots alone.

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

### Idea

Our Idea for the second part of our first project is to create a robot that draws pictures!

### Requested Components

We would attach a pen or marker to the robot and then it would drag it so that the pen drags along the paper as the robot moves. We would get it to draw the top of an icecream cone and then the kids can color it in!

### Schedule

               | Tasks --------                                    | ------ dates             | tasks
               | Mechanical Additions Complete                     | September 15th           | task 1
               | Coding Complete for Circle                        | September 22nd by 2:30pm | task 2
               | Coding Complete for Triangle                      | September 22nd by 2:30pm | task 3
               | Coding Complete for Square                        | September 22nd by 2:30pm | task 4
               | Acquire materials for the community demonstration | September 27th by 9:30am | task 5

## Robot for Community Demonstrations

The basic idea is that we would pre-program the robot to draw certain shapes (like a circle) and then have the kids call the command that makes the robot execute the certain shapes.
They would be actually getting the robot to move without doing any of the super complex coding.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

During this project we actually struggled with some of our hardware. At first everthing seemed to be working smoothly but then our right motor stopped working. This resulted in the right weel not spinning. At first we just thought that the wheel was broken or that the washer wasn't doing it's job properly, but after testing these things, we came to the conclusion that it was in fact the motor breaking. We took a different motor from one of the robots that was not being used and replaced the broken motor with a working one. This fixed our issue with the motor, but we were still struggling with a battery that didn't seem to work as well as it should. We also replaced that piece of the robot and now Penny seems to be running smoothly!

TODO: Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this assignment and describe the biggest learning takeaways.

## Team Work

We all worked extremely well as a team. From the very start we all put together our GoPiGo. We took turns doing each task for building the robot such as with the using the screwdriver for tightening and assembly. When we had to replace the motor Katie and Pallas worked on the hardware while Evelyn was on the computer running the test code. For every step we were on the same page and working together. We all took turns coding and helped check each other's code as we went along. We met outside of class multiple times and everyone showed up each time. Even when there wasn't opportunities for us all to be working on the same thing people still were busy. For example, when Katie and Evelyn were working on fixing the marker rig, Pallas made an artistic representation of the drawing on Adobe Illustrator to be used later as a visual aid when presenting to the larger audience. Katie often times brought the materials such as the paper and markers down from the resource room for the project while Evelyn and Pallas often volunteered their laptops for either programing or using outside resources or the lab. We all took turns catching the bot and handling the hardware and working with the software coding throughout the trial and error process. Overall, the team worked extremely well together and we are satisfied with the results.
