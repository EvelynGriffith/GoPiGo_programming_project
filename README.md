## Introduction

This project is designed to engage the community with engineering and robotics so that children in the community can see what sorts of things a robot like GoPiGo can do. The objective of this project is for the robot to execuste a set of functions that allow it to draw an ice cream cone. The only drawback is that the robot must be altered to include a pen. When I did it, I just taped a pen on to the bottom of the robot. 

### Starting with the robot

- First, begin charging the battery, located in the little brown box.
- Then, it is time to start building your robot. Follow [gopigo's step-by-step instructions](https://gopigo.io/start).
- Once your robot is built, you can connect to the robot by following instructions for [pairing gopigo](https://gopigo.io/pairing-gopigo-os/).

  **Note:** When you are done using GoPiGo, turn off the robot first. Then, after the robot has shut down completely, turn off the rechargeable battery pack. If you turn off the battery before the robot, you run the risk of corrupting the microSD card.

- Finally, play around with your robot. Try to operate it via remote control. Then, begin experimenting with programs in Python.
