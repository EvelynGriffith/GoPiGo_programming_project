## Introduction

This project assignment invites you to work in a team to implement an ethical and/or aggressive robotic behavior while learning how to use `gopigo` robot and program it using Python programming language with a Raspberry Pi. This project consists of two portions. First, using the base `gopigo` robot, teams will participate in the robotic racing competitions during the next lab session. Secondly, teams will design a robotic application using `gopigo` for community demonstrations. Teams are also responsible for writing a detailed report, stored in the file `writing/report.md`. This is a Markdown file that must adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Starting with the robot

- First, begin charging the battery, located in the little brown box.
- Then, it is time to start building your robot. Follow [gopigo's step-by-step instructions](https://gopigo.io/start).
- Once your robot is built, you can connect to the robot by following instructions for [pairing gopigo](https://gopigo.io/pairing-gopigo-os/).

  **Note:** When you are done using GoPiGo, turn off the robot first. Then, after the robot has shut down completely, turn off the rechargeable battery pack. If you turn off the battery before the robot, you run the risk of corrupting the microSD card.

- Finally, play around with your robot. Try to operate it via remote control. Then, begin experimenting with programs in Python.

### 2\. Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

During the second portion of the project, each team will select a task for the robot to complete and then design and implement a `gopigo` robot to complete that task. This part of the project will be showcased during the community event this semester. Since there are no specific requirements or guidelines for this portion of the project, to ensure fairness in the amount of work you dedicate to this project, each team's selected task (what your robot will do) has to be approved by the instructor. In general, each team either needs to propose a unique robot design (e.g., the need to enhance the robot) and a solution for a simple task or a simple design (e.g., minimal need for robot restructuring) with a solution for a more complex task (e.g., involving multiple sensors). You can explore [project ideas at the gopigo](https://gopigo.io/projects/).

Additionally, since this part of the project will be used as an educational resource to get our local community (think, families with children) excited about computing, each team needs to develop concrete motivation for the educational purposes of your robotic design and development. Article on [Educational Robotics and Robot Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2021.662030/full) will give you some background into robotics used for education. Specifically, your project should have:

- Three learning objectives for the proposed demonstration.
- A hands-on component, which will either allow participants to experiment with the robot or observe varying performance of the robot under various scenarios.

You are required to finalize your idea by the end of the day (lab day) on September 15th and write about it in an appropriate subsection of the `report.md`'s "Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations" section. Your team also needs to identify a timeline for completing this portion of the lab and include it in the table in the report. If you are in need of additional supplies that you could not find in ALIC, you need to include the list of supplies in the appropriate subsection of the report as well.

Instructor will review proposed project ideas and notify you of approval or alternate suggestions within 24 hours.
