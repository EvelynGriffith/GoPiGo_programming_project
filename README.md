## Introduction

This project is designed to engage the community with engineering and robotics principles. The GoPiGo robot will draw an ice cream cone through a set of python functions so that children can see what sorts of things a robot like GoPiGo can do. The objective of this project is for the GoPiGo to have two functions. The first will draw a triangle, and the second will draw a set of circles. With all of this in mind, please enjoy wirking on your GoPiGo The easiest way to achieve this is to tape a pen to the underside of the robot.  

### Starting with the robot

- First, begin charging the battery, located in the little brown box.
- Then, it is time to start building your robot. Follow [gopigo's step-by-step instructions](https://gopigo.io/start).
- Once your robot is built, you can connect to the robot by following instructions for [pairing gopigo](https://gopigo.io/pairing-gopigo-os/).

  **Note:** When you are done using GoPiGo, turn off the robot first. Then, after the robot has shut down completely, turn off the rechargeable battery pack. If you turn off the battery before the robot, you run the risk of corrupting the microSD card.

- Finally, play around with your robot. Try to operate it via remote control. Then, begin experimenting with programs in Python.

### Things to consider when working on this project

The only tricky aspect of this project is that the robot can be prone to consistency errors. What should be considered is that the robot's wheels can occassionaly get caught and thus ruin the expereiment. The other thing that I found is that the robot will occassionaly change the percentage of it's turns so that it will end at a place that contradicts the code specifications. The best thing to do to minimize these errors is to limit obstacles and outside varaibles. Make sure that the paper is taped down and on as flat a surface as possible. Also, when testing the percentage of each turn, be sure to try and find the turn angle that is the least prone to error in your environment. If the turns become drastically bad, consider checking the motors on your wheels and replacing them if they are not running properly.
